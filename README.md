Academic Exercises from "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++" &amp; "The C++ Programming Language"

This Repository is a collection of academic exercises and personal notes from Brian Stroustrup's Books from practice. 

The purpose of these exercises are fundamental improvment and understanding the C++ language and programming from a layman's
starting point. A slow and gradual accumulation of projects shows a definitive roadmap of progress and painpoints during the
learning process. My style of learning is strongest when done in full passes of the curriculum, and as such some problems may go 
unresolved if the resources available to me are insufficient to overcome a particular exercise within a reasonable timeframe.
In this event, there will always be documentation to explain my understanding of the problem presented to me and the attempted
solution. I will also try to label the individual project as "PROBLEMATIC" or "UNRESOVLED".

My goal is the same as to any language learner: to become familiar enough with the basic grammar, structure, definitions, and
syntatical variations to achieve the ability to ask and solve basic questions. This is the first step to fluency, I firmly believe.


 There are at least 3 main advantages to the repository:

 1. Centralized location for all projects that can be accessed from any device
 2. Proximity to the coding community where it can be cross-examined or modified
 3. Dedicated repository to serperate it from other types of projects

I will try to use the repository in accordance with these simple tenants and any observers are welcome to add tips
or remarks to help expedite the learning process.
